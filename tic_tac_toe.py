        Each number represents which player has moved in a particular slot.
        X is 1, O is 0, and -1 represents an empty slot.

        The slots are labeled as follows:
        0 1 2
        3 4 5
        6 7 8

        For example, if the game looks like:
        X - O
        X O -
        - X O

        then the state of the game will be
