    '''Prints the progress through a loop.

    If you're running a for loop like `for i in range(max_val)`
    then in the loop you can call printPercent(i, max_val) to print the percentage that the loop is done.
    This doens't work perfectly because of rounding error, but it's close enough.
    (Sometimes it will skip or double print a number.)
